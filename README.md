---
The AntiSLCrush plugin for LabApi is needed so that your server does not break due to errors from game developers/bugs/ddos attacks :)
---

Installation
Download the latest release from the Releases page.
Place the DLL file in LabApi directory.
Configure config.yml as needed.
Download IPTables.
```
sudo apt install iptables
```

# ⚠️ATTENTION⚠️
If your server is not running on a Linux-based system (such as Ubuntu, Debian, etc.) or if you are running the server as a user without sudo privileges, the plugin **will not be able to function correctly**.

(The plugin has no licenses or restrictions, so you can take parts of the code)
